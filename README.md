# CounsellingAssistant
This project is an aid to the students who apply for JoSSA counselling and are stuck in the dilemma of making a counselling list that is the optimal one for them. Applicants are confused as to what they should prioritise more in choosing their college. Our product will be of great help in clearing them of their dilemma. Unlike others, the aim of this website is not just to predict a counselling list based on you rank but we have taken care of your minutest queries and requirements. Our result is basically a tentative list of choices which they can go forward with during counselling.

This project was made as a part of the hackathon of IIIT Allahabad, 'SheHacks 4.0'.

### **Technology Used:**

### **How To Run:**
1. Run Apache and MySQL on Xampp.
2. Import the database counselling.sql to your phpmyadmin

## **Points Considered In Making The List:**
1. Whether they strictly prefer institutes from their own region only.
2. Whether they strictly prefer institutes from their own state only.
3. If the college is one of the IIT’s is it more important to them than branch preference. 
4. If the college is one of the NIT’s is it more important to them than branch preference. 
5. If the college is one of the IIIT’s is it more important to them than branch preference. 
6. Preferred duration of course ie.e 4 years ,5 years or they are okay with both.
7. Branch preference
8. Region preference
9. Get preference from these 6 factors-NIRF,placement,campus,branch,region,how old is the college(i.e. if it supports a good alumni network)


### **Features Implemented:**
1. Login and signup of students and admin.
2. A customized list will be provided based on factors like whether the student prefers to stay close to home (region wise categorization or same city of college), branch preference, JEE/NEET rank, category, gender etc.
3. Admin and user dashboard with all the basic details.
4. Admin can add/delete any new college/branch from the list.
5. A small contact us form for the students to contact the admin.
6. Link to NIRF and other kinds of ranking of colleges.
7. Responsive Design
8. The recommended list can also be downloaded.

## **Future Work:**
1. Implement a chatbot system on the website to take in additional demands from the applicants and provide help.
2. Use a google maps API to accurately give information of the time taken for travelling and distance of institute from applicant's home.
3. Make the recommended list customizable by the user so that the user can make his own changes if he wishes to.
4. Improve UI and design for better User experience.
5. Implement web scraping to get the whole data for better prediction.
